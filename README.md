# RealtekWiFiAdapterSoftware
Software that comes on a tiny little CD with the ["LGTERK 1200Mbps USB 3.0 Wifi Adapter" from Amazon](http://amzn.to/2ECm4ul)

Since not all computers even have CD drives today, it's nice to have a way to download the drivers instead. So, here they are. 

Chipset: Realtek 8812BU Wireless LAN 802.11ac USB NIC

Testing:

 * Windows: works great once you manually install the driver from the CD! Without manually installing the driver it doesn't work at all. 
  * AP (Access Point) mode also works really well for turning this device into a WiFi hot spot! Ex scenario: Use your laptop to connect to the internet via some other way (ex: internal WiFi adapter, Ethernet cable, or tethered phone), then put this external WiFi adapter into AP mode!
  * To put into AP mode: right-click the new "REALTEK USB Wireless LAN Utility" icon (a row of increasing-height green vertical bars) in the System Tray and go to "Open Config Utility", then in the GUI that opens up, click "Mode" --> "Access Point." Use the GUI settings to set a password. 
 * Linux: unk
 * Mac OS: unk
